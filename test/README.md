# aiousb-linux test directory.

These tests are created when developing new features or testing specific issues. There is no effort made to keep them bug free, and in rare cases could cause damage if run with the wrong board.

Please look in the samples to see if there is one that covers the feature you're wanting to exercise before attempting to use anything in this directory.
